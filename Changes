Changelog for Crixa

0.03 2012-04-10T22:31:26
 [Chris Prather <chris@prather.org>]
 - we just need to exclude ^perl5

 - Refactor the RabbitMQ Role into a Class
   
   We need to be able to easily subclass this, and provide it as an
   implementation ot the various internals. This is so we can build out
   different Async backends and (potentially) replace RabbitMQ with
   anything else that supports a similar API.

 - update dist.ini to generate Changes

  [BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES]

  * Renamed the Crixa->connected method to Criax->is_connected. This matches
    what Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ calls the method. For Test::RabbitMQ we call its
    connected method internally.


0.09 2014-11-13

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  * Added a Crixa->connected method.

  * Added an "mq" parameter for the Crixa->connect method that makes it easy
    to mock the underlying RabbitMQ connection using Test::Net::RabbitMQ. Also
    added some docs on mocking.

  [BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES]

  * The entirely undocumented Crixa::Engine::API role and the accompanying
    Crixa::Engine::RabbitMQ class has been removed. This was a layer between
    the Crixa object and the underlying RabbitMQ connection object (like
    Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ) that was intended to support async operations in the
    future. However, async operations can be done more simply by calling the
    various non-blocking message receiving methods in an async callback.

  [BUG FIXES]

  * Almost none of the Crixa classes were made immutable, which makes them a
    lot slower to construct. This is particularly bad for the Crixa::Message
    class.

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  * Added a Crixa::Queue->message_count method.

0.06 2014-10-01

  [BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITIES]

  * Switched from using Net::RabbitMQ to Net::AMQP::RabbitMQ. The former no
    longer passes its tests with recent versions of RabbitMQ.

  * The Crixa class no longer has a ->channels method and it no longer stores
    channels internally. Instead, you call $crixa->new_channel whenever you
    want a new channel.

  * The Crixa class no longer has ->queue or ->exchange methods. This was
    convenient, but made the handling of channels really confusing. Instead,
    you should create a channel and use that to create queues and exchanges.

  * Removed the Crixa::Channel->publish method. Use Crixa::Exchange objects to
    publish messages instead. If you really want to publish without an
    exchange name, you can create an exchange object with an empty string as
    its name.

  * Removed the Crixa::Queue->publish method. This really doesn't make sense,
    since you can't publish to queues. This method would only have worked with
    certain configurations, and it would have been easy to create an
    exchange/queue combination where calling Crixa::Queue->publish sent the
    message to an entirely different queue.

  * The Crixa::Exchange->queue method's "bindings" parameter has been renamed
    to "routing_keys". This is a better match for how these things are
    described in the RabbitMQ docs.

  * Messages are now objects. See the Crixa::Message documentation for details.

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  * Added complete documentation for every class. The docs try to explain
    RabbitMQ concepts wherever appropriate.

  * Added a Crixa::Exchange->delete method.

  * Added a Crixa::Queue->delete method.

  * Added a Crixa::Queue->bind method.

  * All the settings that can be passed to the constructor for Exchange &
    Queue objects are now available as object attributes. This includes things
    like "durable", "auto_delete", etc.
